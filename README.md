# Veritas : on-the-go tax assistant 
## Summary
The proposed project is a tax assistant which operates as an agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
system that will help users with tax computations, receipt management, and invoice processing using optical
character recognition (OCR) . Users can communicate with the system through the chat interface, upload receipts
for them to extract OCR based data, set up reminders for tax payments that sync with Google Calendar, and prompt
users to perform tax related tasks. Structured data is stored in Airtable and intelligent tax related help is provided by
the system using a Large Language Model (LLM) [Google Gemini].
